<p>There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the
following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you
specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from
the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level
(bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the
password for the next level (bandit21).</p>

works as you think</p>
