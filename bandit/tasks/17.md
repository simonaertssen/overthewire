<p>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to <strong>a port on localhost in the range
31000 to 32000</strong>. First find out which of these ports have a server
listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which
donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the
others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</p>
