<p>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from
<strong>cron</strong>, the time-based job scheduler. Look in <strong>/etc/cron.d/</strong> for
the configuration and see what command is being executed.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This level requires you to create your own first
shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of
yourself when you beat this level!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once
executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…</p>

<h2 id="commands-you-may-need-to-solve-this-level">Commands you may need to solve this level</h2>
<p>cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)</p>
